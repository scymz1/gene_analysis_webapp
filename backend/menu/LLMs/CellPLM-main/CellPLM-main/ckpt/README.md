## Model Checkpoints

Please download and place pre-trained model checkpoints here. A model checkpoint consists of two files: a model config (`.config.json` file) and a torch ckpt (`.best.ckpt` file), which share common prefix. The checkpoints can be found on our [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/i5rmxgtqzg7iykt2e9uqm/h?rlkey=o8hi0xads9ol07o48jdityzv1&dl=0).
